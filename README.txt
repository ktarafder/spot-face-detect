Spot (Cognitive Companion) faceDetect *brief instructions*

Make sure to point your IDE to the spot folder as the main directory (if using VSCode, File > Open File > spot *as the main folder).

Images to be encoded need to be located in the Images directory (spot\\faceDetect\\Images), filename format firstname_lastname.jpg or png,
and resized to 216 x 216.

After adding new images to the Images directory, you must run EncodeGenerator.py, which updates the EncodeFile.p file, before re-running main.py

To quit the live feed and stop the program, either press 'q' on the keyboard or simply close the pop-up gui.

Have fun and feel free to add/link any integrations before/after this faceDetect functionality!
